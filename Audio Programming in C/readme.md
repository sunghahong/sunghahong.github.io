# sunghahong.github.io / Audio Programming in C             

The following repository contains assignments I have worked on while currently taking the EP-353 Audio Programming in C course at the Berklee College of Music with professor Akito van Troyer.

Week1 folder contains a .csd file (Csound) of my transcription of a melody that can be played in Terminal.

Week2 folder contains a .c file (C) of my replication of the RTPC (Real-Time Parameter Control) feature in Unity and Wwise, and theoretically using this in video games for the player's health system.
