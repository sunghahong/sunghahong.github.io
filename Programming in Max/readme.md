# sunghahong.github.io / Programming in Max            

The following repository contains a Max patch I have worked on while currently taking the EP-341 Programming in Max course at the Berklee College of Music with professor Jean-Luc Sinclair.

Final Project folder contains a Max patch, in which I have attempted replicating the Random Container feature in Wwise.
